# KORE

Imagine scrolling through an article, a social media post, or a news website—how do you know what’s true? Misinformation is everywhere, and fact-checking takes time. That’s why we built Kore, a browser extension that fact-checks information in real time and helps users dig deeper into their research.

Kore is a browser extension that analyzes text on a webpage and cross-references it with credible sources. When users highlight a claim, Kore instantly searches trusted fact-checking databases and research archives to verify its accuracy. Our AI-powered assistant also provides contextual summaries, helping users understand the broader picture beyond just ‘true’ or ‘false.’ Kore doesn’t just flag misinformation—**it guides users to deeper research.**
